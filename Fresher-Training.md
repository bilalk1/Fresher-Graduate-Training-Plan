- Branching
- Push / pull
- Commit creation / templates
- Merge requests
- Conflicts resolution

- Reverting a commit
- Cherry-picking a commit
- Self code-reviews before submission 

**Programming Language**

- Variables, Data Types, Type Conversion, Loops, Conditionals, Undefined, null, Type Coersion
- Functions (expressions, declarations)
- Scopes (global, function, block), 
- Variable Hoisting
- Compilation vs Interpretation, Debugging
- Objects (Literals, Constructor Functions, Methods, Nested Objects, dot vs brackets notation for access)
- Arrays - read docs of common array methods,
- Nested Functions, Anonymous Functions, IIFE and when to use it
- Functions/Code as arguments
- Closures
- Object methods and uses of "this" 
- 4 flavours of this, Apply vs Call
- Function "arguments" array, Object.assign
- Read about Date, Math, string
- Prototypical Inheritance/OOP in JS
- Event Loop, Async Flows, setTimeout
- Async/Await vs. Promises  

**Web Concepts**

- Client-servier communication Models (HTTP, Pub-sub and Sockets, Async communication, ...)
- Communication of app's different components (such as DB, Server, Frontend, Web)
- Authentication and Session Management
- Server-side and Client-side Rendering
- Caching (types of caches on BE and FE) 
- High-level components of BE application 
- Browser Understanding (inspection, debugging, profiling etc..) 
- Security (HTTPs)
- Misc Topics (User-agent, CORS, content-negotiation, Long Polling, HTTP-2 etc..)
